        <blockquote>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</blockquote>
        <p>
          Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
          Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River
          of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of
          folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of
          the river that they never left. Herds of elk and deer graze on the
          hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also
          commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring
          ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and
          provide shelter from sun or rain when needed. Let's not forget the
          rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest
          undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the
          water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower,
          slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all
          summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to
          appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

      <div class="paragraph-2-headline">Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</div>
      <div class="column2of2"></div>
      <p class="paragraph2">
        Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate
        land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river
        and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great
        rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand
        Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts
        outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of
        prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater
        opportunities. Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in
        6 days. Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.
        This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the
        canyon tells. Gray Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater
        with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river
        experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater
        rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only
        by river. Right from the start, youâ€™ll have a smile glued to your face.
